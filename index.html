                   son: "Gotta walk the district."<br>

                        Ehrhardt and her opponent, Republican Earnest Leonard, have been pounding the pavement to introduce themselves to voters
                         in a re-drawn District 107, which includes the north- ern half of Oak Lawn, sections of cen- tral and east Dallas, and a 
                         northern swath east of central expressway jutting up to the LBJ Freeway.<br>
                        
                        Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse- ment of the political action committee of Lesbian/Gay Political Coalition of Dallas. 
                        Leonard received the endorse- ment of Log Cabin Republicans of Dallas.<br>
                        
                        The candidates get-out-the-vote efforts are kicking into high gear for election day. With statistics and maps of every square inch of the district, 
                        it seems, Ehrhardt plans to have an army of about 30 "poll pushers" at voting sites handing out pro-Ehrhardt litera- ture, in addition to running a phone 
                        bank to remind people to vote and coordinate transportation to the polls.<br>
                        
                        Ehrhardt said surprise its the most common response she gets when knocking on doors. Most people say they have never met their representa- tive in the Texas Legislature before, 
                        a situation which she said she finds frus- trating, given her efforts to get out in the district.<br>

                        Gay and lesbian issues will almost certainly be featured in the 1997 legisla- tive session. 
                        The Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas plans to offer several proposals, as well as to fight off expect- ed anti-gay bills:<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square"><li>
                        Hate crimes. Both candidates for District 107 have pledged to support a hate crimes bill, which would stiffen criminal penalties for crimes motivated by religious, racial, or anti-gay preju- dice. 
                        Leonard said he generally sup- ports anti-crime measures. Ehrhardt is widely credited with being a leader in last session's attempt to pass a revised hate crimes bill, which narrowly failed in the House.</li>

                   <li> Employment Non-Discrimination. Leonard opposes a gay civil rights bill to outlaw job discrimination against gays and lesbians, saying such mea- sures inevitably lead to "frivolous law- suits," but he has pledged a policy of</li>
